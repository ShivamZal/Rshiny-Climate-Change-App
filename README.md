# Rshiny-Climate-Change-App
<h4> Climate change, characterized by the persistent rise in global average temperature, is a pressing issue shaped by various factors such as population growth, deforestation, and industrial activities. Over the past century and a half, the evidence of this phenomenon is stark, with global land temperatures showing a consistent upward trajectory. For instance, between 1913 and 2015, the average land temperature increased by 1.53 degrees Celsius, mirroring similar trends in the United States where temperatures rose by 1.01 degrees Celsius during the same period.

In this exploration, a Shiny App has been developed to delve deeper into less-explored facets of climate change. Specifically, this investigation focuses on the impact of geographical location, examining how latitude and longitude correlate with temperature variations over time. Through the integration of datasets sourced from Berkeley Earth and meteostat.net, both static and interactive maps are generated, shedding light on temperature trends globally and within the United States. By employing tools like plotly, ggplot, leaflet, and leafdown, this analysis aims to unveil the nuanced relationship between climate change and geographic coordinates.<h4>
